    recreate_game(game, player)

Creates an exact (deep)copy of the input game,
and then re-samples the _unobserved_ cards (i.e.,
the opponent cards and unobserved table cards).

This is useful for repeatedly sampling a specific
scenario so that we can compute the expected value
of a particular action.

TODO: we could make a mutating, in-place version of
this to reduce allocations.
